Brawl Stage Manager is a program that uses BrawlLib to help you see and
organize the stages, module files, and stage portraits that are installed on
your SD card (or in whatever folder, on whatever device, you use for Brawl
hacks.) It can also add PAT0 entries for expansion stages (with an automated
process) and change certain PAT0 entries (through a special dialog.)

Changes in 4.1.1:
  * BrawlLib (StageBox) updated (to StageBox 0.8 hotfix 1)

----------------------------------------

Hint: In the "change directory" dialog, select your SD card and hit OK. If
there are no .pac files in the root of your SD card, the program should jump
to /private/wii/app/RSBE/pf/stage/melee or /projectm/pf/stage/melee instead,
if it exists. (Try using the "Start in" field in the shortcut properties.)
You can also run BrawlStageManager.exe from the root of your SD card for the
same effect.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
PageUp:             Go up one stage (focus does not need to be on the stage list)
PageDown:           Go down one stage (focus does not need to be on the stage list)
Tilde (~):          Display PAT0 modification dialog
Left bracket ([):   Replace border around icon (4-pixel margin) with pixels from
                    border.png in application folder, or one that comes with Stage
                    Manager if no border.png exists
Right bracket (]):  Generate a new FrontStname using a configurable font

-------- Notes --------

You can copy your icons to the sc_selcharacter2 (Random Stage Select menu) and
to the mu_menumain (for My Music) from the Tools menu.
* For sc_selcharacter2, Stage Manager will read your Custom SSS code (if any)
  to figure out which stages will be selectable and copy the icons accordingly.
* For mu_menumain, Stage Manager will replace each of the STGCUSTOM icons with
  a warning icon for My Music only. (MenSelmapIcon.XX will be used if present;
  otherwise, an icon embedded in BrawlStageManager.exe will be used instead.)
  Music titles will also be copied from info.pac if it exists.

-------- Detailed Instructions --------

The left side of the window has a list of stage .PAC files in the current
directory; you can change the directory through the Options menu. Choosing a
stage file will display:
    * The filename, root node name, and filesize of the .PAC
    * The filename, internal name, and filesize of the matching .rel file (if it exists)
      * By default, the program searches for .rel files in ../../module, but
        through the Options menu you can tell the program to search the current
        directory instead.
      * If the .rel file has the wrong ID for the stage it's replacing, a button
        will appear allowing you to fix it automatically.
    * Any MSBin nodes in the .pac file, starting with the last (shown by default)
      * Some stage authors often put info about the stage in these nodes. This
        program will display them read-only; you can edit them with BrawlBox.
    * If Options>Render Models is checked: the 3D models that make up the stage itself
      * You can hide a particular texture by unchecking it in the Model Textures list
      * Note: using "Preview All Models" in BrawlBox is another way to examine a stage
    * If Options>Load .brstms is checked: any .brstms associated with the stage
      * Select the .brstm from the small menu to the left of the audio player.
      * You can export or delete the .brstm by right-clicking the menu.
      * You can replace the .brstm by dragging a new .brstm onto the audio player.
You can use Page Up and Page Down to go up and down the stage list, even when
it doesn't have focus.

Stage Manager can also perform certain operations on stage and .rel files:
    * Right-click on the button to pull up a menu, which lets you delete the
      .pac file or the .rel file. You can also export both files, a .brstm
      file (in some cases), and all stage portraits to a folder, which you
      can then import later by dragging the folder onto the center panel.
    * Drag and drop a .pac file onto the left-hand stage list to copy it to the
      working directory. The program will ask what filename to save it as.
    * Drag and drop a .pac or .rel file onto the center information display to
      replace the current .pac or .rel file. Windows will ask before overwriting.

The right sidebar will display (top to bottom):
    * Stage preview (MelSelmapPrevbase)
    * Stage icon (MenSelmapIcon)
    * Icon number (PAT0 key; XX in MenSelmapIconXX)
    * "Generate name" button  (same as "]" button on keyboard)
    * Stage name (MenSelmapFrontStname)
    * Series icon (normally MenSelchrMark, but in my pack I sometimes rename
      it to SeriesIcon to avoid confusion)
    * Game logo (MenSelmapMark)
    * A filesize bar that compares your sc_selmap size to the one in the game -
      going over this limit could cause freezing at the stage select screen!
To replace one of these images, drag and drop an image file onto it. You can
also right-click on the image and choose Replace or Export.

All of these textures are looked up in the PAT0 entries in the common5, so
they will match the ones you see in-game. You can edit the PAT0 entries for
MenSelchrMark and MenSelmapMark using the Modify PAT0 button (or by pressing
the tilde (~) button on your keyboard.)

Project M 3.6 splits the stage preview (MenSelmapPrevbase) into two parts; you
can replace these parts individually by dragging and dropping a PNG or GIF
file onto the "PM 3.6 top" or "PM 3.6 alt" boxes.
