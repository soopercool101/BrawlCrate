Brawl Song Manager is a program that uses BrawlLib to quickly view which BRSTM
music files are installed on your SD card (or in whatever folder, on whatever
device, you use for Brawl hacks.)

Changes in 4.1.1:
  * BrawlLib (StageBox) updated (to StageBox 0.8 hotfix 1)

----------------------------------------

The left side of the window has a list of .BRSTM music files in the current
directory; you can change the directory through the File menu. When you choose
a .BRSTM file, the right side of the window will display the playback module
from BrawlBox, allowing you to listen to the song.

In the bottom-left corner is a control for modifying the Custom Song Volume
code, which will be read from your GCT codeset if it exists. You can also use
it to add the code to your GCT. If a warning or speaker icon appears in the
corner of this editor bar, mouse over the icon for more information.

To replace a song, drag the new .BRSTM or .WAV onto the main panel.
To add a song, drag a .BRSTM or .WAV onto the menu and enter a filename.
Right-click the .BRSTM in the menu for other options (Export, Rename, Delete).

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
PageUp:      go up one song (focus does not need to be on the song list)
PageDown:    go down one song (focus does not need to be on the song list)

----------------------------------------

If you have an info.pac file in ..\..\info2\info.pac, ..\..\info2\info_en.pac,
or .\info.pac, then the program will load that file and allow you to change
song titles (when applicable) - unless you have Misc Data [140].msbin in the
current directory, in which case the program loads that instead. You can save
your changes through the File menu or by pressing Enter in the text box.
The "Restore" button resets the song title to the one loaded from info.pac,
while the "Default" button loads the default Brawl name for that slot.

If you have an info_training file, that will be updated as well. If song names
in the two files are different, the text box will be colored red.

----------------------------------------

Use the "change directory" dialog to select the folder that has BRSTM files in
it. This could be sound/strm (or sound/sfx with the Custom Sound Engine.)

Hint: In the "change directory" dialog, select your SD card and hit OK. If
there are no .brstm files in the root of your SD card, the program should jump
to /private/wii/app/RSBE/pf/sound/strm or /projectm/pf/sound/strm instead, if
one exists. (Try using the "Start in" field in the shortcut properties, or
running BrawlSongManager.exe from the root of your SD card.)

----------------------------------------

Importing and Exporting Song Files

Both importing and exporting first require changing directory to an appropriate
"SD  card". Then under the Tools menu there are options to import or export 
song files.

Export will output songs on the current SD card to the folder you choose. In 
the directory you choose it will create a number of directories for each stage
and inside each stage directory it will place the songs for that stage. Songs
that do not have a custom file on the SD card will have place-holders exported
as empty files that users can then replace. The empty files will be ignored 
when importing.

After songs have been exported, users can edit song volumes or titles, or even
replace songs. The only requirement is that the file name format conforms to
the format specified below. The 'game-file-name' should remain unchanged, and 
there should only be one of each 'game-file-name'.

Import will scan (recursively) in the directory you choose for *.brstm files 
that match the file name format specified below. Any matching files will be 
copied onto the current SD card with the appropriate "game-file-name" as the
file name. mu_menumain.pac and info.pac will updated, and if found on the SD
card, training_info.pac and the GCT codes will also be updated. Note that the
stage directories are ignored when importing (they are just an aid for users). 

The file name format for the files exported / imported is:
    <game-file-name>.<volume>.<song-title>.brstm 
Some examples of this format are:
    W05.35.Yoshi's Island (Melee).brstm
    Y05.0.Boss Battle Song 1.brstm
    
When imported, a volume of 0 will reset the volume for that song to default, 
while volumes above 127 (the max) will be set to 127.
